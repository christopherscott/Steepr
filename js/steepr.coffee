class Steepr
  updateType: (e, index, element) ->
    # update tea type based on index, class name, or maybe data-attrib

  steep: (args) ->
    # switch to steeping page
    # start the (visually) updating timer
    # start the (actual) timer ^ should they be the same
    # start the background animation
    # save the current steeping in localStorage:
      # if current steeping > preferred:
        # trigger alert, asking if to procede
        # if yes, continue
        # if restart, update localStorage 'steeping', continue
        # if just no, cancel action
      # if otherwise continuing:
        # save the current steeping in tea type record in localStorage:
          # steepr-green: "2"
    # once done steeping, return to homepage


  # not sure what method/function to put these yet:
    # upon rendering of homepage, check for local storage steepings, update graphics
    # restart button: for each tea type, maybe top-left, furthest from right-handed thumbs or underneath
    # upon rendering of homepage, check for presence of custom times localStorage, load if present
    # cutomize: editable table of tea times for user to update: on update, save to localStorage:
      # steepr-custom-times: { "green" : "93,60,45,30", "white": "120, 110, etc..."}
    # built-by page, with giant/circle picture of my avatar
    # steep! button to trigger steeping
    # maybe double-click on tea will reset times
    # confirm dialog for resetting tea times
